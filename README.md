## Why?
During my trips, I tend to ask everyone I meet to share their favourite bands/artists... it happens that usually I don't have an Internet connection, and also happens that by the time I go to check out the list of suggestions, people had added stuff in their own way (aka. there's no one single format for the information gathered).

After some years, I came across one of these lists with hundreds of items, so I decided to build something to help me with the task of sorting all of it.

And here we are.

## What?
Simple. Insert plain text (could be a list of items or a single one) and get information from Wikipedia and the most relevant video from Youtube from each item.

Originally it was thought for music, but it's usefull for any other kind of information: Movies, plants, animals, places, TV-shows, games, products... even mixed lists of elements.

## Roadmap

- [x] Parse plain text into an array of elements
- [x] Display Wikipedia page (if available)
- [x] Fetch most relevant video from Youtube (based on the searched item)
- [ ] Allow delimiters edition/customization (for parsing plain text input)
- [ ] Implement locale selection (for more specific results by country/language)
- [ ] Add category selection (more accurate search when input items from same category)

## Donate

Do you like what I do?

I develop projects like this one (checkout [@vuegg](https://github.com/vuegg/vuegg) my other child) on my spare time, after work hours, homie weekends... or during summer holidays like in this case.

Contribution is the most desirable help always, but for those with no much time in hands that still want contribute somehow...

Your donation will help me to stay awake during those hours I should be sleeping. And make me really happy in general.
